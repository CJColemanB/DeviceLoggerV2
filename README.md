## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3** installed on your system.
- **Flask** installed on your system.
- **Pandas** installed on your system.
- **OpenPyXL** installed on your system.
- **Setup your environment** by doing the following:
   - Install [Python]([url](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) for your device
   - Install Python3 by typing ```python3``` into your terminal
   - Open your terminal or cmd application
   - install the libraries:
     ```bash
     python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install flask
     pip install pandas
     pip install openpyxl
     ```

### 1. Run the Application

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt in that directory.
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### 2. Admin Access Credentials

- Upon starting `app.py`, unique admin credentials (username and password) are generated and displayed in the terminal:
  ```
  ================================================== 
  !!! ADMIN ACCESS CREDENTIALS !!! 
  USERNAME: admin_xxxx 
  PASSWORD: [a complex string] 
  Please use these to log into the /admin panel. 
  Credentials are valid ONLY for this session. 
  ================================================== 
  ```

### 3. Using the Website

- **Home Page (`/`):** Main navigation for Loan, Return, and Admin functions.
- **Loan Device (`/loan`):**
  - Fill student details (Name, Surname, Email).
  - Filter available devices by category.
  - Select a device and click "Loan Device".
- **Admin Panel (`/admin`):**
  - Log in with generated credentials.
  - Add new devices (category, rubric, suffix).
  - View active loans and mark devices as returned.
  - Review full loan history with timestamps.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Database Schema

The system uses three main tables:

- **devices:** Inventory (rubric_id, suffix_id, category, availability).
- **students:** Borrower information (name, surname, email).
- **loans:** Links students and devices per transaction; records loan and return timestamps.

### Device Return Logic (Admin Panel)

When "Mark as Handed In" is clicked in the Admin Panel, `app.py` processes the device ID, locates the device, and sets the `return_time` for the active loan entry. The device status is updated to available in real time.
